# Intro to React

Presentation slides for React geared towards mid/junior devs that have done some ASP.NET MVC and Angular.

[Run on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jimbolla/intro-to-react)

Based on [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate).

## Getting Started

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open a terminal and run 
```bash
yarn
```
or 
```bash
npm install
```
if you're about that life.

Next, run 
```bash
rm -R .git
```
to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run
```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll.

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running
```bash
npm run build
```

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run 
```bash
npm run deploy
```
